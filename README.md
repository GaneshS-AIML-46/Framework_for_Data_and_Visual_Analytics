## 🧪 Experiment Details  

### 1. 🐍 Setting Up Python Environment  
- Set up the Python environment with Jupyter Notebook.  
- Demonstrated Python code execution, Markdown formatting, and interactive widgets like sliders, text inputs, and buttons.

### 2. 📥 EDA: Data Import and Export  
- Imported datasets from CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and web scraping.  
- Exported DataFrames to Excel files using pandas and SQL libraries.

### 3. 🧹 EDA: Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and data type conversion.  
- Applied normalization techniques with MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler.

### 4. 🔍 EDA: Data Inspection and Analysis  
- Inspected dataset structure using head, tail, dtypes, and info.  
- Filtered data, calculated key statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

### 5. 📈 EDA: Data Visualization with Matplotlib  
- Created line charts, bar charts, histograms, and boxplots for exploratory analysis.  
- Visualized score distributions and group comparisons.

### 6. 💻 Data Visualization Using Power BI  
- Connected to Excel, CSV, and SQL data sources.  
- Built bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and interactive dashboards with slicers and calculations.

### 7. 🎨 Data Visualization Using Tableau  
- Used Tableau interface for connecting to data sources.  
- Created various charts (bar, line, pie, bubble, heat maps) and dashboards.  
- Developed calculated fields and interactive data stories.

## 🚀 Mini Project: Tesla TSLA Stock Price Predictor  

- A Streamlit web app predicting Tesla's next day closing stock price using a pre-trained LSTM deep learning model.  
- Fetches historical Tesla stock price data from 2015 to present using yfinance and displays interactive matplotlib charts.  
- Predicts next day's price based on last 60 days closing prices with scaling and inverse transformation to original price scale.  
- Provides a clean user interface with a "Predict Tomorrow's Price" button and disclaimer on educational use.
